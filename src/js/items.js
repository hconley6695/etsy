I mean, Who has extra outlets around the house that aren&#39;t in use? And when you actually find one is it ever where you need it to be? Who likes the look of cords running along their floor to said outlet? All of these things seemed to be problems in my home so I decided to take the idea of a night light or liquor light (great idea for use in a bar area) and make it battery operated! Problem solved! This edgy, unique fun light can go anywhere you want, and the first set of batteries ARE included! This new take on an old idea is sure to make this product a lot more user friendly and at this price you get this amazing light and convenience... who can beat that! Oh and battery pack is affixed to bottle, bottles are as pictured with caps and first set of batteries are included.... plus my items are ready to ship within 1 to 2 business days! Cant beat that especially at this price :) Excellent gift idea or home accent! Have many other bottles available as well, keep checking back!  Available in the RARE edition Bird Dog Whiskey\n\nPhotos don&#39;t do these justice!!! Bright! Great nightlights! Look great day or night! \n\nLocal customers ( within 20 mile radius of 48185 or 49270) please email me at coach11786@gmail.com before purchasing I may be able to save you shipping costs and deliver your purchases to you :)","creation_tsz":1457547294,"ending_tsz":1468084494,"original_creation_tsz":1457547294,"last_modified_tsz":1457547295,"price":"28.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["liquor lights","night light","luminary","battery operated","bar","gift","heartfelt","Liquor","Man cave","Rare","Unique","Bird dog","Hunting"],"category_path":["Housewares","Lighting"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,69154917],"materials":["Liquor bottle","drill","glue","batteries","strand of lights","magnets"],"shop_section_id":18677152,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1457547294,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/271483933\/the-improved-rare-bottles-liquor-light?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":0,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1093,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Lighting","Night Lights"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":936578941,"hex_code":"A45950","red":164,"green":89,"blue":80,"hue":6,"saturation":51,"brightness":64,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457547294,"listing_id":271483933,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/131\/0\/12329717\/il_75x75.936578941_tigp.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/131\/0\/12329717\/il_170x135.936578941_tigp.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/131\/0\/12329717\/il_570xN.936578941_tigp.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/131\/0\/12329717\/il_fullxfull.936578941_tigp.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":844},{"listing_image_id":936579221,"hex_code":"979391","red":151,"green":147,"blue":145,"hue":20,"saturation":3,"brightness":59,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457547294,"listing_id":271483933,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/12329717\/il_75x75.936579221_gb1k.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/12329717\/il_170x135.936579221_gb1k.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/12329717\/il_570xN.936579221_gb1k.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/111\/0\/12329717\/il_fullxfull.936579221_gb1k.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":844},{"listing_image_id":936579293,"hex_code":"8B827F","red":139,"green":130,"blue":127,"hue":15,"saturation":8,"brightness":54,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1457547294,"listing_id":271483933,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12329717\/il_75x75.936579293_1o01.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12329717\/il_170x135.936579293_1o01.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12329717\/il_570xN.936579293_1o01.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/107\/0\/12329717\/il_fullxfull.936579293_1o01.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":844}],"Shop":{"shop_id":12329717,"shop_name":"HeartfeltWaxCreation","user_id":51115031,"creation_tsz":1453158016,"title":"Heartfelt wax creations & gifts","announcement":"Great shop for great gift ideas!

We have tinkered with a few of these and found a fine point black sharpie marker works the best. Then just spray it with a semi gloss polyurethane and you&#39;re finished. You can then turn this into a work of art for your wall, a lazy Susan, a serving tray, a table top, etc. the options are endless.

We started Wunderkammer in 2013 with the idea of finding great art to decorate the walls of our own new home. The fun we had rediscovering great art of the past lead us here to share and offer these great prints to cozy home dwellers around the world.\n\n~Paul is a professionally trained and internationally exhibited photographer with two degrees (BFA & MFA) in his field. His nearly two decades of print making experience and his exacting eye are brought to every print that passes through our studio. \n~Elena is a Librarian by trade. Her curiosity keeps us fawning over new(old) material and keeps our Etsy shop walls ever-expanding with art, and her deft organization makes sure our studio is humming day in and day out.\n\n************************************************************************************\nHAVE A QUESTION? \n\nSend us a message here via Etsy!
